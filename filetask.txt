My name is Sreya, and I hail from the picturesque town of Palakkad. At 22 years old, I've already completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. Beyond academics, I have a passion for crafts, finding joy in the intricate details and creative expression they offer. Whether it's knitting, origami, or DIY projects, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of crafts, where every piece tells a story and sparks imagination.
